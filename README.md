## Overview of project

I found this Deck of Cards API a few weeks back and have been wanting to do something with it. I am teaming up with Alex Ackerlund and Ransom Bowman on this project where we will create a web application using the ReactJS JavaScript framework and the site will be hosted on GitHub pages for deployment. Some of the tools we want to work with are:

ReactJS, NodeJS and use dependencies of:

- React Router (to allow for navigation)
- Styled-Components (to allow us to syle our code with CSS)
- GitHub pages (for deployment)
- Axios (for HTTP requests)

The goal is to have a website/web app that has navigation between card games like Blackjack, Solitare, FreeCell, etc.

The API we are using is the [DeckOfCardsAPI.com](http://deckofcardsapi.com/)
